# SQLRockbusterAnalysis
## This is a CareerFoundry Data Analytics project learning SQL
###### Objective: The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. 
###### Context: To answer the questions posed by the different departments, you’ll query the data using SQL. Throughout this Achievement, you’ll learn SQL incrementally, and you’ll use it to answer increasingly complex business questions for each task. The results of your analysis will be presented to Rockbuster management, so you’ll need to visualize the data in an easy-to-consume manner.
